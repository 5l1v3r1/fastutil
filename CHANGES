1.3 -> 1.4

- Introducing TreapMap, the new high-performce, low memory-footprint
  implementation of SortedMap.
- Fixed a bug in hashCode() and contains() for HashMap.drv (it was
  considering keys only!).
- Fixed a bug in contains() for entrySet() in all maps (it was using
  VALUE_EQUAL to test equality for values given as objects).
- I realised that a default return value can be useful also for maps
  returning objects, so now you have it.
