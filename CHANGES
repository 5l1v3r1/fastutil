1.3 -> 2.0

- Introducing the new high-performce, low memory-footprint implementation of
  SortedMap.
- Fixed a bug in hashCode() and contains() for HashMap.drv (it was
  considering keys only!).
- Fixed a bug in contains() for entrySet() in all maps (it was using
  VALUE_EQUAL to test equality for values given as objects).
- I realised that a default return value can be useful also for maps and sets
  returning objects, so now you have it. It is even independent for submaps and
  subsets.
- Classes are no longer final. The performance gain is around 1%, and
  the decrease in usefulness is orders of magnitudes greater.
- We now check equality using first hashCode() and then equals().
- Revolutioned approach: now maps have names depending on the specific
  implementation. Two tree implementations are available: RB trees and
  AVL trees. Both implementations are threaded.
- The tests for speed now warm up the trees by doing repeated insertions
  and deletions, so that the benefits of a better balancing criterion
  are more evident.
- The regression tests are much more stringent.
