- Loops in sorting for big arrays should use real indices, not get/set
- Check that binary insertion sort is maybe better
- radix sort for big arrays
- Navigable sets and maps
- Front-Coded Array BIG lists
- Make digit array in radix sort shorter
- FastIterable interface
- Put back compare() methods when we stop supporting Java 6
- Try tripartite quickSort or TimSort for generic sorting.
- MUST FIX iterators from a given position for linked sets/maps so they are constant time
