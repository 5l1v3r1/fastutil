- Loops in sorting for big arrays should use real indices, not get/set
- Junit tests for new sets/maps and [big]lists (static containers)
- Document everywhere radix sort.
- document running time of in-place mergesort
- Check that binary insertion sort is maybe better
- Indirect stable radix sort!!
