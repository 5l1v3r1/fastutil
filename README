Welcome to fastUtil, a set of specialized Java classes that implement the Map
and Set interface of the java.util package.

fastMaps provides a huge collection of specialized map classes generated
starting from a parameterized version; the classes are much more compact and
much faster than the general ones. See the package documentation for more
information.

The compiled code is contained in fastMaps.jar, and should be installed where
you keep Java extensions.

The source are generated using a C preprocessor, starting from a driver
file. The C code includes the driver code and some #define that customises the
environment. The gendrivers.sh script will generate the (fake) C sources from
the driver file. Then, you have to "make" to get the actual Java sources, the
jar file and the tar archive. Note that you need ant
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/). If you remove the definition of NDEBUG from
the gcc options in the Makefile, a main method will be compiled in each class:
it performs a regression test or a speed test on n elements, when called with
arguments "regressionTest n" or "speedTest n", respectively.
