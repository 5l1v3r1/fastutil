Welcome to fastUtil, a set of specialized Java classes that implement
that Map and Set interface of the java.util package.

fastMaps provides a huge collection of specialized map classes generated
starting from a parameterized version; the classes are more compact and much
faster than the general ones. 

The compiled code is contained in fastMaps.jar, and should be installed where
you keep Java extensions.

The source are generated using a C preprocessor, starting from a driver
file. The C code includes the driver code after some #define that customized
the environment. You have do "make jsources" to get the actual Java sources, or
"ant" to get the compiled classes. If you remove the definition of NDEBUG from
the gcc options in the Makefile, a main method will be compiled in each class:
it performs a regression test or a speed test on n element, when called with
arguments "regressionTest n" or "speedTest n", respectively.

The doc directory contains javadoc-generated documentation.
