	 <P>Provides data and static methods used by all implementations.

      <P>Classes in this package are not type-specific. They exists for three
      main reasons:

      <ol>

      <li>There is no generic interface in {@link java.util} for certain data
      types provided by <code>fastutil</code>, for instance, {@linkplain
      it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.BidirectionalIterator bidirectional iterators} and
      {@linkplain it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.PriorityQueue priority queues}.

      <li>Certain static objects and methods are universal and completely
      generic: for instance, there is just one {@linkplain
      it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.Sets#EMPTY_SET empty set} which implements all
      interfaces, and just one {@linkplain
      it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.Maps#MISSING "missing object value"} for maps with
	<code>null</code> values.

      <li>Certain interfaces are generic even if the instances are
      type-specific, a typical example being that of {@linkplain
      it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.IndirectPriorityQueue indirect priority queues}.
