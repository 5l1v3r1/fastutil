	 <P>Provides data and static methods used by all implementations.

      <P>Classes in this package are not type-specific. They exists for two
      main reasons:

      <ol>

      <li>There is no generic interface in {@link java.util} for some data
      types provided by <code>fastutil</code>, for instance, {@linkplain
      it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.BidirectionalIterator bidirectional iterators} and
      {@linkplain it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.PriorityQueue priority queues}.

      <li>Some interfaces are generic even if the instances are
      type-specific, a typical example being that of {@linkplain
      it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.IndirectPriorityQueue indirect priority queues}.
