	 <P>Provides type-specialized hash maps and sets with a small memory
	 footprint, much (2 to 10 times) faster access and insertion, but
	 (relatively) slow enumeration. It is <A
	 HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</A>
	 distributed under the <A
	 HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"><ACRONYM TITLE="GNU's not
	 Unix">GNU</ACRONYM> General Public License</A>.

	 <h2>Package Specification</h2>

	 <p>The classes of this package specialize the most useful {@link
	 java.util.HashSet} and {@link java.util.HashMap} classes to versions that
	 accept a specific kind of key or values.

	 The general format is</p>
		<div style="padding: 1em">
		  <var>valuetype</var> <var>settype</var>
		</div>
		<p>for sets, and</p>
		<div style="padding: 1em">
		  <var>keytype</var> 2 <var>valuetype</var> <var>maptype</var>
		</div>
	 <p>for maps.Thus, an {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.IntHashSet} stores
	 integers efficiently, whereas a {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Long2IntHashMap} does the same for maps from long
	 integers to integers. By "type" here I mean a capitalized primitive type,
	 or {@link java.lang.Object}.</p>
	 
	 <p>Since there are eight primitive types in Java, we get 194 (!) classes
	 (some nonsensical class, such as <code>Boolean2BooleanHashMap</code>, are
	 not generated). Many classes are generated just to mimic the hierarchy of
	 {@link java.util} so to redistribute common code in a similar way.</p>
	 
	 <p><b>All classes are not synchronized</b>. If multiple threads access one
	 of these classes concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies it,
	 it must be synchronized externally. Iterators will behave unpredictably in
	 the presence of concurrent modifications.

	 <h3>Interfaces implemented</h3>
	 
	 <p>All maps and sets in <code>fastUtil</code> implement their standard
	 counterpart interface (e.g., {@link java.util.Map} for maps). Thus, they
	 can be just plugged in existing code, using the standard access (of course,
	 any attempt to use the wrong type for keys or values will produce a
	 {@link java.lang.ClassCastException}). However, they also provide (whenever
	 possible) many polymorphic versions of the most used methods that allow to
	 avoid the tedious "type juggling" that is well known to Java
	 programmers. In doing so, they implement more stringent interfaces that
	 extend the standard ones.</p>
	 
	 <p>These new interfaces add some methods, which are rather obvious, and I
	 suggest you to have a look at some of them. There are just a few
	 <i>caveat</i>, mainly due to some arbitrary restriction of Java:

	 <ul>
		
		<li>The versions of the {@link java.util.Map#get(Object)}, {@link
		java.util.Map#put(Object,Object)} and {@link
		java.util.Map#remove(Object)} methods that return a primitive type
		cannot, of course, rely on returning <code>null</code> to denote the
		absence of a certain pair. Rather, they return a <em>default return
		value</em>, which is set to 0 cast to the return type(or
		<code>false</code> for booleans) at creation, but can be changed using
		the <code>setDefRetValue()</code> method. Note that
		changing the default return value does not change anything about the data
		structure; it is just a way to return a reasonably meaningful result, and
		it can be changed at any time.</li>
		  
		<li>For all maps that have object as keys, the {@link
		java.util.Map#get(Object)} and {@link java.util.Map#remove(Object)}
		methods do not admit polymorphic versions, as Java does not allow
		return-value polymorphism. Rather, the extended interfaces introduce new
		methods of the form <code>get<var>valuetype</var>()</code> and
		<code>remove<var>valuetype</var>()</code>.

	 </ul>

	 <h3>Additional methods</h3>
 
	 <p>Again, due to some limitation of Java (you cannot override an interface
	 method with a method returning a more specific value) there are some
	 features of <code>fastUtil</code> that are available only by means of type
	 casting. In particular, key and value sets from a map are of the
	 <code>fastUtil</code> type you expect (e.g., the key set of an {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Int2LongMap} is an {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.IntSet}), but you must explicitly cast the object
	 returned by {@link java.util.Map#keySet()} to the appropriate type.

	 <p>Similarly, all iterators have a suitable method returning directly a
	 primitive type: however, you must cast explicitly the object returned by
	 {@link java.util.Set#iterator()} to the appropriate type.

	 <h2>Performance</h2>
	 
	 <p>The main reason behind <code>fastUtil</code> is performance, both in
	 time and in space. The relevant methods are something like 2 to 10 times
	 faster than those of the standard classes. 

	 <p><code>fastUtil</code> reduces enormously the creation and collection of
	 objects. First of all, if you use the polymorphic methods and iterators no
	 wrapper objects have to be created. Moreover, since <code>fastUtil</code>
	 uses closed hashing, creation and garbage collection of table entries are
	 avoided (but tables have to be rehashed whenever they are filled
	 by more than 3/4).

	 <p>Note that since deletions are handled simply by tagging, they are very
	 fast <i>per se</i>, but they tend to slow down subsequent accesses (with
	 respect to a set with the same number of element, but no deleted entries).

	 <h2>Memory usage</h2>

	 <p>To avoid memory waste, I keep no additional information about elements
	 (such as a list of keys). In particular, this means that enumerations are
	 always linear in the size of the table (rather than in the number of
	 keys).</p>

	 <p>The memory footprint for a table with <var>n</var> keys is exactly the
	 memory required for the related types times <var>n</var> bytes, plus a
	 overhead of <var>n</var> bytes to store the state of each entry. The
	 absence of wrappers around primitive types can reduce space occupancy by
	 several times (this applies even more to serialized data, e.g., when you
	 save such a data structure in a file).  These data can greatly vary with
	 your virtual machine, JVM versions, CPU etc.

	 <p>More precisely, when you ask for a map that will hold <var>n</var>
	 elements with load factor 0&lt;<var>f</var>&le;1, <var>p</var> entries are
	 allocated, where <var>p</var> is first prime in {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Hash#primes} larger than
	 <var>n</var>/<var>f</var>. Primes in {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Hash#primes} are roughly multiplicatively spaced by
	 2<sup>1/16</sup>, so you lose on average about 2% with respect to
	 <var>n</var>/<var>f</var>.

	 <h2>Robustness</h2>
	 
	 <p>The code in <code>fastUtil</code> has passed intensive regression
	 tests. You can trust it much in the same way you trust the standard
	 classes.</p>
