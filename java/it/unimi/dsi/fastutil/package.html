	 Provides type-specialized hash maps with a small footprint optimized for
	 fast access and insertion, but (relatively) slow enumeration and
	 deletion. It is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence.

	 <h2>Package Specification</h2>

	 <p>The name of a hash map class is
		<div style="padding: 1em">
		  <var>keytype</var> 2 <var>valuetype</var> <var>maptype</var>.
		</div>
		Thus, a <code>Long2IntTreeMap</code> maps ordered long
		integers to integers. By "type" here we mean a capitalized primitive type,
		or <code>Object</code>.</p>
	 
	 <p>Since there are eight primitive types in Java, we get 71 (!) map classes
	 (some nonsensical class, such as <code>Boolean2BooleanHashMap</code>, are
	 not generated).</p>
	 

	 <h3>Interfaces Implemented</h3>

	 <p>All maps in <code>fastMaps</code> implement the <code>Map</code>. Thus,
	 they can be just plugged in existing code, using the standard access (of
	 course, any attempt to use the wrong type for keys or values will produce a
	 <code>ClassCastException</code>). However, they also provide (whenever
	 possible) many polymorphic versions of the most used methods that allow to
	 avoid the tedious "type juggling" that is well known to Java programmers,
	 and greatly enhance performance by avoiding creating temporary objects. In
	 doing so, they implement a more stringent interface that extend the standard
	 one.</p>

	 <p>This new interface adds some methods, which are rather obvious, and I
	 suggest you to have a look at some of them. There are just a few
	 <i>caveat</i>, mainly due to some arbitrary restriction of Java:
		<ul>
		  
		  <li>The versions of the <code>get()</code>, <code>put()</code> and
		  <code>remove()</code> methods that return a primitive type cannot, of
		  course, rely on returning <code>null</code> to denote the absence of a
		  certain pair. Rather, they return a <em>default return value</em>,
		  which is set to 0 cast to the return type(or <code>false</code> for
		  booleans) at creation , but can be changed using the
		  <code>setDefRetValue()</code> method. Note that changing the default
		  return value does not change anything about the data structure; it is
		  just a way to return a reasonably meaningful result, and it can be
			 changed at any time. (However, you cannot change the default return
			 value of a submap.)</li>
		  
		  <li>For all maps that have object as keys, the <code>get()</code> and
			 <code>remove()</code> methods do not admit polymorphic versions, as Java
			 does not allow return-value polymorphism. Rather, the extended
			 interfaces introduce new methods of the form
			 <code>get<var>valuetype</var>()</code> and
			 <code>remove<var>valuetype</var>()</code>. Similar problems occur
		  with <code>first()</code>, <code>last()</code> and so on.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Performance</h2>

		<p>The main reason behind <code>fastMaps</code> is performance, both in
		time and in space. The relevant methods are something like 2 to 10 times
		faster than those of the standard classes. The memory footprint for a
		table of size <var>n</var> is exactly the memory required for the related
		types times <var>n</var> bytes, plus a overhead of <var>n</var> bytes to
		store the state of each entry. The absence of wrappers around primitive
		types can reduce space occupancy by several times (this applies even more
		to serialized data, e.g., when you save such a data structure in a
		file). These data can greatly vary with your virtual machine,
		JVM versions, CPU etc.</P>

	   <p>To minimize the memory footprint, the classes to not keep any
		additional information about elements. In particular, this means that
		deletions are made simply by tagging suitably an entry, and that
		enumerations are always linear in the size of the table (rather than in
		the number of entries).</p>

	   <p>Note that since deletions are handled simply by tagging, they tend to
		slow down access.

		<h2>Robustness</h2>

		<p>The code in <code>fastMaps</code> has passed intensive regression
		tests. You can trust it must in the same way you trust the standard
		classes.</p>
