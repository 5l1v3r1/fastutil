	 <P>Provides classes and static methods that make object I/O easier and faster.

      <P>Classes in this package provide very efficient, unsynchronised buffered
	input and output stream (with support for repositioning, too). Static container
	provide instead a wealth of methods that can be used to serialise/deserialise
	more easily objects and arrays.
