	 <P>Provides type-specific classes for character elements or keys.

         <P>Note that because of the clash with {@link List#remove(int)}, the
      	type-specific removal method of an {@link IntCollection} is {@link
      IntCollection#rem(int)}.
      This is fixed for sets by reintroducing {@link IntSet#remove(int)}, but,
      for instance, if you want to remove an element from a list you will
      need to use <code>rem()</code>.
